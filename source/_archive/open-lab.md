## Seven Months of Building and Staying Sober

There’s one side of me that says writing here again is freedom, and another side that says it’s dumbness. Maybe both are true.

It has been seven months since I wrote my last line of code for Student Crowd, the company where I worked for over a year. As soon as I received the notice that my contract wouldn’t be renewed, I did what I was used to doing — what many developers do: clean the dust off an old blog and start writing again. This time it felt different. I wasn’t just between jobs. I was let go, and though I had been in that position before, this time I was struggling to maintain my mental resilience.

What I didn’t tell anyone is that I’m an addict. I’ve been sober since then — seven months, the longest stretch since I recognized my abuse patterns at 23. Post-pandemic, it hit me harder than ever.

Every company I’ve worked for gave me second, third, and sometimes more chances. They didn’t want to let me go, but I became the shading guy — disappearing slowly. Still delivering tasks, but skipping meetings, fading out of presence. That’s why I never asked for referrals. Not because people disliked me, but because the version of me they saw wasn’t the whole one.

Even though I could deliver, that way of working is selfish and can’t last long.

So, in these months sober, I turned inward and built things. Not for a company, not for deadlines, but for myself — as a way to learn, to stay focused, and to see what I was capable of when I actually showed up.

What I’ve built over the past few months is what I’ll be sharing here. I’m not promising a publishing schedule. I’ll write when I can, but I will publish. For me, this is a way of keeping myself honest. For anyone reading, it’s an invitation to see what I’ve been working on.

Here’s the roadmap — the areas I’ve been exploring:

1. **Fonts** — fonttools, jq/yq pipelines, metrics, Unicode, languages, font pairing
2. **Colors** — harmony, variations, contrast checking, image color extraction
3. **Accessibility** — color vision deficiency (CVD) analysis and transformations
4. **Playground** — a space for snippets, demos, and experiments
5. **Privacy Monitoring Extension** — a Chrome extension that tested what browsers expose
6. **HTTP Archive Research** — analysis of robots.txt and font usage across the web
7. **Lighthouse Research** — digging deep into performance audits and metrics

Each of these already exists in some form — code, repos, diagrams, notes. What I’ll do here is unpack them, explain why they matter to me, and what I learned while building them.

This is how I’ll start again: with honesty, and with the work that kept me going.
