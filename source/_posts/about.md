## Hi there 👋 — I’m **Leonardo Poletto**

A technologist focused on improving how the web is built and experienced.

As the founder of [WizardCompass](https://wizardcompass.com), I lead the design and development of tools that transform complex technical audits into actionable insights. My work blends engineering, research, and ethical responsibility—helping developers, designers, and digital teams build faster, more accessible, privacy-respecting, and standards-compliant websites.

Over the years, I’ve shifted from just shipping websites to **questioning how we build them**—and more importantly, why. Today, my focus is on creating scalable foundations that promote **transparency**, **performance**, **accessibility**, and **user respect by default**.

⸻

### Core Focus Areas:

- Web Accessibility & Compliance (WCAG, ARIA, assistive tech)
- Privacy & Security Headers (CSP, DNT, GDPR)
- Web Performance (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)
- Technical Auditing & Research-Driven Insights
- Developer Education and Documentation Strategy

⸻

> Whether I’m refining HTML semantics, debugging a CSP violation, or guiding a team toward better digital practices, **my goal stays the same: build the web—better**.
