## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€” Iâ€™m **Leonardo Poletto**

A technologist focused on improving how the web is built and experienced.

As the founder of [WizardCompass](https://wizardcompass.com), I lead the design and development of tools that transform complex technical audits into actionable insights. My work blends engineering, research, and ethical responsibilityâ€”helping developers, designers, and digital teams build faster, more accessible, privacy-respecting, and standards-compliant websites.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve shifted from just shipping websites to **questioning how we build them**â€”and more importantly, why. Today, my focus is on creating scalable foundations that promote **transparency**, **performance**, **accessibility**, and **user respect by default**.

### Core Focus Areas:

- Web Accessibility & Compliance (WCAG, ARIA, assistive tech)
- Privacy & Security Headers (CSP, DNT, GDPR)
- Web Performance (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)
- Technical Auditing & Research-Driven Insights
- Developer Education and Documentation Strategy

> Whether Iâ€™m refining HTML semantics, debugging a CSP violation, or guiding a team toward better digital practices, **my goal stays the same: build the webâ€”better**.
