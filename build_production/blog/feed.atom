        <p>There‚Äôs one side of me that says writing here again is freedom, and another that says it‚Äôs pointless ‚Äî like walking a familiar path that has led nowhere before. Maybe both are true.</p>

<p>But this time, there‚Äôs one difference: consistency.
I‚Äôm not making promises to anyone but myself. No publishing schedules, no expectations. Just showing up, writing, and sharing what I‚Äôve been building over these past seven months.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a period of creating tools, experimenting with ideas, and turning research into something tangible. Some of it worked, some of it didn‚Äôt, but all of it taught me something worth sharing.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find here: code, projects, lessons, and insights collected along the way. For me, writing is a way to stay honest with my own work. For anyone reading, it‚Äôs an open invitation to follow along ‚Äî if only to see where this path leads this time.</p>

<h2>From Checklists to Craft</h2>

<p>When I first started optimizing my site, I chased Lighthouse scores like everyone else. Pass the audits, hit 100, move on. But I realized I was treating standards like a checklist, not as part of the craft.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when I started <strong>Wizard Compass</strong> ‚Äî not just another Lighthouse wrapper, but a tool to explain <em>why</em> each audit matters.</p>

<p>I have mapped the curriculum to match Lighthouse category groups:</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<ul>
<li>Metrics (core scoring metrics)</li>
<li>Diagnostics (fix opportunities)</li>
<li>Hidden (supporting ‚Äúinsights‚Äù)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility (A11y)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>ARIA</li>
<li>Color &amp; Contrast</li>
<li>Tables &amp; Lists</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Best Practices</li>
<li>A11y (Ungrouped audits)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

<ul>
<li>UX</li>
<li>JavaScript Libraries</li>
</ul>

<h3>SEO</h3>

<ul>
<li>Crawl</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to receive updates on the course development access <a href="https://wizardcompass.com/">wizardcompass.com</a>, subscribe to the early access list.</p>

<h2>Privacy in the Browser</h2>

<p>While digging into audits, I noticed how invisible privacy issues are. So I built a <strong>Chrome extension</strong> that shows what sites are collecting and doing in the background.</p>

<p>I never published it, but it taught me how much is hidden ‚Äî and how easily developers embed third-party scripts without realizing the trade-offs.</p>

<p>The trickier part was mapping players, so I've leveraged <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/wappalyzer">Wappalyzer</a> data from their last open source version, which HTTP Archive uses to enrich its dataset.</p>

<p>I will write an article about it in detail and open-source the project soon.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fonts and Readability</h2>

<p>Color contrast checks got me wondering: why do formulas ignore the font itself? JetBrains Mono and Cabin are not the same.</p>

<p>So I started parsing Google Fonts with <code>fonttools</code> and <code>jq</code>, looking at metrics, x-height, and spacing. That became the seed for <strong>Font Lint</strong>.</p>

<p>You can take a look at <a href="https://fontlint.com">fontlint.com</a> and subscribe to be the first to test new font optimization tools and have access to datasets.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Colors and Accessibility</h2>

<p>I love playing with colors, but I wanted palettes that were not only harmonious, but also accessible. I experimented with <strong>Delta E 2000</strong> to ensure that the generated colors were perceptually distinct.</p>

<p>Then I added a <strong>contrast fixer</strong>: it suggests tweaks to color, font size, or weight until the text meets WCAG accessibility standards.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Seeing Differently</h2>

<p>Accessibility isn‚Äôt abstract for me ‚Äî I have high myopia and astigmatism. That‚Äôs what led me to simulate <strong>color vision deficiencies (CVDs)</strong>.</p>

<p>I built transformations that show how colors and images look under different impairments, then validated whether the differences were still perceptible.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cvd-matrix-before.webp" alt="Contrast Matrix Built by Leonardo Poletto" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ratings are calculated by first converting the colors to their simulated counterparts. The simulated values approximate the colors that would be seen by the fully deficient vision of each particular type. The simulated colors are then compared using the <code>DeltaE 2000</code> color difference formula. A color difference value of <code>11</code> or <strong>more</strong> is <strong>considered passing</strong>; anything lower is too similar to distinguish.<br><br> The color difference meters visualize the <code>DeltaE</code> value to indicate how different the colors would appear for each color vision deficiency.<br> <br><em>Source: <a href="https://leonardocolor.io/tools.html">https://leonardocolor.io/tools.html</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cvd-matrix-after.webp" alt="Contrast Matrix Built by Leonardo Poletto" /></p>

<p>I've explored images, which I will also write about. This is an unseen world by most people, and I intend to share my discoveries.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>This is just the beginning of Open Lab. Each post will unpack one of these projects, with more code, demos, and lessons. I‚Äôm not chasing a schedule ‚Äî I‚Äôll publish as I can. But I will publish.</p>

        <h2>Hi there üëã ‚Äî I‚Äôm <strong>Leonardo Poletto</strong></h2>

<p>A technologist focused on improving how the web is built and experienced.</p>

<p>As the founder of <a href="https://wizardcompass.com">WizardCompass</a>, I lead the design and development of tools that transform complex technical audits into actionable insights. My work blends engineering, research, and ethical responsibility‚Äîhelping developers, designers, and digital teams build faster, more accessible, privacy-respecting, and standards-compliant websites.</p>

<p>Over the years, I‚Äôve shifted from just shipping websites to <strong>questioning how we build them</strong>‚Äîand more importantly, why. Today, my focus is on creating scalable foundations that promote <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>user respect by default</strong>.</p>

<p>‚∏ª</p>

<h3>Core Focus Areas:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Web Accessibility &amp; Compliance (WCAG, ARIA, assistive tech)</li>
<li>Privacy &amp; Security Headers (CSP, DNT, GDPR)</li>
<li>Web Performance (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)</li>
<li>Technical Auditing &amp; Research-Driven Insights</li>
<li>Developer Education and Documentation Strategy</li>
</ul>

<p>‚∏ª</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether I‚Äôm refining HTML semantics, debugging a CSP violation, or guiding a team toward better digital practices, <strong>my goal stays the same: build the web‚Äîbetter</strong>.</p>
